	a interactive user interface in the terminal.

	to change the backlight on the computer.

	are not running X. However, it is still suitable for desktop
	computers and can be used inside X. In fact it seems to work
	for all machines with backlight, which is not true for
	xbacklight(1). adjbacklight uses /sys/class/backlight.
	adjbacklight as been retrofitted to be convenient for use
	inside X on desktop computers, with commands that lets it
	be used non-interactively with hotkeys set up in xbindkeys(1).
